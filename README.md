# Conway's Game of Life
This is the classic version of Conway's Game of Life implemented in Javascript using 2D arrays and HTML Canvas. 
I am using some of the code from this (http://disruptive-communications.com/conwaylifejavascript/) tutorial, but my goal is to implement a custom drawing function (done) and custom controls for the area size, tick speed, preset patterns, and eventually create an evolving ecosystem with different types of cellular automata.
